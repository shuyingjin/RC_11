Summary'}, 2: {'title': 'Understanding', 'authors': 'Veselin Penef', 'description': \"The book reveals the Reality of Life. Life's origin, Life's reason for existence is answered. The personal choice for the self, self-creation, is shown. Life's Eternity, Life's Indestructible Nature is proven. The immortality of the soul is proven. The book proves God's existence. Unlimited power is disproven. The philosophy of the book is titled the one philosophy. The One Philosophy includes all opposites, the Middle Ground between which is taken and confirmed. All that is lacking of the good is exposed. Philosophy is the answer to knowledge of the good, not religion, not democracy. The philosopher-king is advocated. The three main human objectives are put forth: understanding of Life's laws, the creating of the good society, the need to live in peace. Only philosophy has the answers. This book marks the new human beginning. It is groundbreaking. The phony, not-so-peaceful-andloving, the real Jesus Christ is exposed. The destruction of Jesus Christ is complete. The greatest human questions are answered. The basis of future humanity will be the One Philosophy\"}, 3: {'title': 'India', 'authors': 'Shyam Ratna Gupta', 'description': 'Articles, previously published in Indian and foreign review, English semimonthly.'}, 4: {'title': 'Effort and Grace', 'authors': 'Simone Kotva', 'description': \"Philosophy and theology have long harboured contradictory views on spiritual practice. While philosophy advocates the therapeutic benefits of daily meditation, the theology of grace promotes an ideal of happiness bestowed with little effort. As such, the historical juxtaposition of effort and grace grounding modern spiritual exercise can be seen as the essential tension between the secular and sacred. In Effort and Grace, Simone Kotva explores an exciting new theory of spiritual endeavour from the tradition of French spiritualist philosophy. Spiritual exercise has largely been studied in relation to ancient philosophy and the Ignatian tradition, yet Kotva's new engagement with its more recent forms has alerted her to an understanding of contemplative practice as rife with critical potential. Here, she offers an interdisciplinary text tracing the narrative of spiritual exertion through the work of seminal French thinkers such as Maine de Biran, Félix Ravaisson, Henri Bergson, Alain (Émile Chartier), Simone Weil and Gilles Deleuze. Her findings allow both secular philosophers and theologians to understand how the spiritual life can participate in the contemporary philosophical conversation.\"}, 5: {'title': 'Physics of the Human Temporality', 'authors': 'Ihor Lubashevsky, Natalie Plavinska', 'description': 'This book presents a novel account of the human temporal dimension called the “human temporality” and develops a special mathematical formalism for describing such an object as the human mind. One of the characteristic features of the human mind is its temporal extent. For objects of physical reality, only the present exists, which may be conceived as a point-like moment in time. In the human temporality, the past retained in the memory, the imaginary future, and the present coexist and are closely intertwined and impact one another. This book focuses on one of the fragments of the human temporality called the complex present. A detailed analysis of the classical and modern concepts has enabled the authors to put forward the idea of the multi-component structure of the present. For the concept of the complex present, the authors proposed a novel account that involves a qualitative description and a special mathematical formalism. This formalism takes into account human goal-oriented behavior and uncertainty in human perception. The present book can be interesting for theoreticians, physicists dealing with modeling systems where the human factor plays a crucial role, philosophers who are interested in applying philosophical concepts to constructing mathematical models, and psychologists whose research is related to modeling mental processes.'}}\n"
